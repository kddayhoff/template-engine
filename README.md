# Employee Template Project
This application is created to help an employer submit employee information based on an individuals' role from the command line into a browser-friendly document using Node.js

## Technology

Javascript, Node.js, and markdown(.md) - inquirer npm and tests
​​
## Installation

To install this code, clone the files from the repository https://github.com/kddayhoff/template-engine and open in your preferred code editor
​
## Usage 
​
On the terminal/gitbash, enter node app.js. From there the user will be prompted to choose if they want to build a team, should they choose "build a team", the user will be presented with questions about the employee's information, and based on that employee's role, the user will answer an additional question. To create another employee file, the user will choose the build a team prompt, otherwise the user will choose "finish team". The application will automatically generate a preformatted HTML that he/she can open in their browser.

Feel free to make this better. It's like Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, nothing is original. Take an axe for example, you're not going to reinvent the axe. However, you can always leave it sharper than when you found it.
